You are given a simplified 3x3 Sudoku board filled with numbers 

(Please see Word and XML files attached).

Validation rules are:

  We need to have all digits from 1 to 9 present
  Each digit can only appear once
  The sum of all digits has to be equal 45

Check all numbers manually and figure out which once are invalid (if any). 
Write a program that reads the XML input and validates all numbers. 

Each invalid number and its location should be printed in the output.

Your program should run in this format:

java myprogram

Validating Sudoku grid
Found following invalid numbers:
1. Row 1 Column 2 Value 7
n. ...

Modify the original XML and create new file with correct numbers.

Run your program again. Your program should run differently:

java myprogram

Validating Sudoku grid
Sudoku grid is valid
